<span>**Course Description:**</span>
Digital Humanities or “DH” brings the application of computing to
humanities questions. In this course, we will explore applying
computational methods including text analysis, mapping, and network
analysis to humanities data. Our guiding questions include:

-   What is humanities data?

-   Why apply computational methods to the humanities and how?

-   Which methods are best for which forms of inquiry?

-   What new forms of scholarly inquiry are made possible?

-   What are the challenges and limitations of DH?

Throughout the semester we will address these questions while learning
different methods. Generally, the first class of each week will be
dedicated to discussing the readings and the second will be a practicum
where we will apply methods. By the end of the course, we will:

-   Become familiar with the core concepts and methods of DH

-   Understand how to apply DH methods to answer scholarly questions

-   Articulate the stakes of DH scholarship

-   Learn how to work collaboratively in the humanities

The course will culminate in a final project.
*No prior programming experience expected or required.*

<span>**Grading:**</span>

-   20% Participation

-   30% Short Projects (10% each. Rubric will be provided.)

-   50% Final Project

<span>**Late Work:**</span>
Turning in late work reflects poorly on you. Please avoid it at all
costs. Any late work receives a letter grade deduction for each class
period it is late.

<span>**Academic Integrity:**</span>
Students are expected to pledge the following statement on all
assignments turned in for credit, including exams, papers and laboratory
reports: "I pledge that I have neither received nor given unauthorized
assistance during the completion of this work.” Academic honesty
is—defined broadly and simply—the performance of all academic work
without cheating, lying, stealing, or receiving assistance from any
other person or using any source of information not appropriately
authorized or attributed. The University of Richmond and I personally
take academic honesty very seriously. All students are responsible for
maintaining the highest standards of honesty and integrity in every
phase of their academic careers. The penalties for academic dishonesty
are severe and ignorance is not an acceptable defense. For more
information on URʼs commitment to building intellectual integrity,

http://studentdevelopment.richmond.edu/student-handbook/honor/the-honor-code.html

<span>**Attendance:**</span>
Students are responsible for all information in the class, regardless of
their personal attendance. If a student is absent, it is their
responsibility to inquire about what they have missed. Absences due to
university activities (e.g., sports, debate, etc.) must be discussed
with the instructor before the relevant class period(s). An official
notice must be shown to the instructor. Arrangements concerning absences
are entirely at the instructor’s discretion. Absences, unless for
documented illness, emergency, or university business, will result in a
loss of participation points. More than 5 absences may result in an “F”
for the semester.

<span>**Readings:**</span>
Most of the readings in this course consist of journal articles, blog
posts, and chapters from edited volumes. These will all be available
digitally, for free, from the course website (some may require you to be
behind the University of Richmond firewall).
